\subsection{Learning to learn and filter prediction}
It is not a new idea to learn neural networks that predict the parameters of another. It is one of the approaches found for \textit{learning to learn}.  A few authors \cite{schmidhuber1992learning,bertinetto2016learning,jia2016dynamic} , in particular, have proposed to apply such idea in their works. We explore this idea under total different motivations. Our motivations are a) to enable the ability of representing shape as spatial distribution instead of any specific point set b) to handle the \textit{sampling variation} and \textit{semantic variation} separately.
