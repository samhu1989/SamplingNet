	abstract="Shape deformation requires expert user manipulation even when the object under consideration is in a high fidelity format such as a 3D mesh. It becomes even more complicated if the data is represented as a point set or a depth scan with significant self occlusions. We introduce an end-to-end solution to this tedious process using a volumetric Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that learns deformation flows in 3D. Our network architectures take the voxelized representation of the shape and a semantic deformation intention (e.g.,Â make more sporty) as input and generate a deformation flow at the output. We show that such deformation flows can be trivially applied to the input shape, resulting in a novel deformed version of the input without losing detail information. Our experiments show that the CNN approach achieves comparable results with state of the art methods when applied to CAD models. When applied to single frame depth scans, and partial/noisy CAD models we achieve                                                                                   {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}sim {\}}60{\backslash},{\backslash}{\%}{\$}{\$}                   less error compared to the state-of-the-art.",

	abstract="Surfaces serve as a natural parametrization to 3D shapes. Learning surfaces using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is a challenging task. Current paradigms to tackle this challenge are to either adapt the convolutional filters to operate on surfaces, learn spectral descriptors defined by the Laplace-Beltrami operator, or to drop surfaces altogether in lieu of voxelized inputs. Here we adopt an approach of converting the 3D shape into a `geometry image' so that standard CNNs can directly be used to learn 3D shapes. We qualitatively and quantitatively validate that creating geometry images using authalic parametrization on a spherical domain is suitable for robust learning of 3D shape surfaces. This spherically parameterized shape is then projected and cut to convert the original 3D shape into a flat and regular geometry image. We propose a way to implicitly learn the topology and structure of 3D shapes using geometry images encoded with suitable features. We show the efficacy of our approach to learn 3D shape surfaces for classification and retrieval tasks on non-rigid and rigid shape datasets.",
