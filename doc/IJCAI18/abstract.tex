  A neural network can be a powerful agent that executes complicate operation(s) on input data, therefore carry out certain tasks. It is possible to exploit such power iteratively, that is to train a network to design/predict other networks to carry out the task. In this paper, we explore this idea on the task of ``3D Shape Generation from a Single Image ". We design a network that predict networks that map from a predefined parameter domain. We evaluate our approach on the ShapeNet\cite{shapenetdata} dataset and comparing to \cite{PSGN} .The comparison shows that a)
