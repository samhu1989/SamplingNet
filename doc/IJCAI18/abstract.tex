  A neural network can be a powerful agent that executes complicate operation(s) on input data, therefore carry out certain tasks. It is possible to exploit such power iteratively, that is to train a network to design/predict other networks to carry out the task. In this paper, we explore this idea on the task of ``3D Shape Generation from a Single Image ". We design a network that predict networks that map from a predefined parameter domain. We evaluate our approach on the ShapeNet (\cite{shapenetdata}) dataset and shows that (a) Our network is able to output different networks that map a predefined parameter domain to different 3D shapes. (b)  (c) Our approach quantitatively matches previous 3D Shape Generation methods with fewer free parameters in the network.
